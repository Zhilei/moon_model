Moon thermal model for millimeter wave observations

This package contains temperature and polarization model of the Moon from 40 GHz to 300 GHz. The model is primarily based on observations from the Chang'E lunar mission.
More description of this model is dicussed in [Xu et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...891..134X/abstract), please also cite this paper when using this
package.

This model not only provides a brightness temperature model, it also provides the polarization pattern of the Moon, with correct sky orientation observed by any terrestial observers at designated observation time.

This model provides calibration information from the Moon in both temperature and polarization for microwave instruments from 40 GHz to 300 GHz.
